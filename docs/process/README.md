A software development process or a software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. It includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain, or replace a software system. SDLC involves several distinct stages, including planning, design, building, testing, and deployment. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model, and Agile model.

## Process

In **`Archway`** we create a software base on agile model but have some customizations to define and execute our processes and focuses strongly on helping developer teams to be successful.

1. [`Planning and requirements analysis`](requirement-analysis.md): converting the customer's requirements into a practical design.

2. [`Software architecture, design, and modeling`](design.md): detailed guidance on designing applications to use specific technologies.

3. [`Code and testing`](implementation.md): development environment depends on the type of application being built, and the code languages used.

4. [`Reviews, project and code management, and reporting`](manageproject.md): Project management help individuals be successful in a team environment, speed up development, and manage the development lifecycle.

5. [`Project release, maintenance and training support`](release.md): An important task is project release that steps to go to the final project then need to maintain and create documentation of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement.

## Summary

The development process is most important in software development. Its help development team can create software according to how they define and execute their processes.
