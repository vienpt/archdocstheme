## Use cases

It can also be used to design use case, component dependency and interconnection diagrams, and model database schemas as part of the detailed plan.
For example, Figure 4 shows the use case designer in astah professional.

## Server-side development

Creating RESTful services, also known as as web APIs, using [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). To create a web API, reference [docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio). For example, Figure 5 shows architecture for backend side.

## Client-side development

The most web application is using modern single page application [(SPA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa-services?view=aspnetcore-3.1) frameworks. That is an ideal choice for internal company applications and customer-facing sites such as Angular, Reactjs, and Vuejs.

[Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
