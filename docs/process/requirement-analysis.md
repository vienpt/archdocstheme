Requirements analysis is the first stage. The requirements may be provided as documents, diagrams.  

To collect and analyze requirements we can use tools and applications such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and XMind for defining goals, planning times and costing development projects at this initial stage. For example, Figure 2 shows the goal of defining after analysis of the Customer's requirement.

From goal defining we can break down to the story, pick it up to implement, and it helps affect the planning process to make schedule and estimate times. From that, planning for the project is the next step to implement per/week, per/month depends on the application. For example, Figure 3 shows project planning.
