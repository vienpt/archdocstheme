The release stage, also known as “deployment,” involves releasing the completed software into the production environment and performing post-production activities, such as monitoring. Additional testing occurs in the production environment. Final deployment takes place once all bugs are discovered and resolved.

An important task is [`documenting`](https://veinz.netlify.com/learn/demoday_27092019.html) the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement.

Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered problems or new requirements can take far more time than the initial development of the software.
